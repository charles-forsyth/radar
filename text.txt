to view image click on 
The lifespan of IT skills is growing shorter as organizations scramble to modernize the toolsets of their workers amidst rapid AI deployment efforts. By 2027, more than 40% of IT skills will be rendered partially obsolete. The shift can be attributed to the rapid adoption of AI within IT departments, as well as the increasing consolidation of roles and skill sets. While tech jobs are not disappearing outright, the way work gets done is certainly changing. AI is compressing skill cycles, reshaping roles and shifting where productivity comes from faster than most organizations expect.

WebProNews, January 15

According to the new Economic Index report from Anthropic, AI is fast becoming a technology that augments rather than eliminates human roles. The report is based on real-world interactions, where users from various sectors turn to AI for tasks ranging from coding to creative brainstorming. The report introduces five foundational metrics that gauge the role of AI in the workplace. These include user and AI skills, task complexity, autonomy levels, success rates, and the purpose of use, whether personal, educational, or professional. By querying Claude on real-world interactions, Anthropic has uncovered patterns that suggest AI is more of a collaborator than a competitor.

According to the latest ADP employment data from December, hiring slowed while layoffs stayed at historically low levels. While those results point to a softening market, pay growth held strong. The reason for that is clear: employees who switch jobs can command a premium from their new employers. While pay growth for job-stayers stayed at 4.4 percent from November to December, increases jumped from 6.3 percent to 6.6 percent for job-changers.

How AI Is Reshaping IT Careers
BuiltIn.com, January 14

to view image click on 
The last two years have proven that the impact of AI on the workforce is no longer hypothetical. Large-scale layoffs driven by automation began in the second half of 2025 and will continue through 2026 as organizations optimize workflows and streamline repetitive tasks. Yet the picture is far more nuanced within IT. Contrary to early predictions of sweeping displacement, IT careers are stabilizing. According to a new survey, fewer than 25 percent of IT organizations expect to downsize in the coming year, while fully half plan to add staff.

Spiceworks.com, January 12

For entry-level IT workers, a job search can be difficult. Especially for remote positions, openings are routinely flooded with hundreds or even thousands of applicants. After all, when you are up against candidates in other cities or even countries, competition can be intense for coveted roles. Adding to the challenge of landing an IT job, universities are turning out more tech graduates than in previous years, which translates to more people chasing after entry-level IT jobs. The number of students earning an undergraduate degree in computer and information sciences has more than doubled over the last decade.

Artificial Intelligence: Managing the Unmanageable
Blog@CACM, January 14

to view image click on 
Recent advances in artificial intelligence have started to challenge the long-held assumption that tasks performed by computers are predictable, controllable, and safe. In the past, computer scientists programmed machines to complete tasks; now, they are programming them to reach goals and letting them find their own way to get there. It is like the difference between giving someone instructions to assemble something and asking them to build a specific item from scratch. The technical term for this is non-deterministic computing, which means we no longer fully know what our software will do next. This uncertainty changes everything about how we need to think.

Techno-Optimism, Techno-Pessimism, and Techno-Realism
Communications of the ACM, December 18

to view image click on 
When it comes to the adoption of new technology, computer science professionals can be divided into three distinct categories: techno-optimists, techno-pessimists, and techno-realists. Techno-optimists argue that technology is the glory of human ambition and achievement and often call for unrestricted technological progress. On the other hand, techno-pessimists lay out scenarios for how AI models could become all-powerful and eventually pose an existential risk to humanity. Techno-realists attempt a more nuanced take on the impact of AI.
